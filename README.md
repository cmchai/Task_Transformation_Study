# This is the offcial repository of the Task Transformation Study

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether people can dynamically modulate their task preparation based on the level of task uncertainty.

## Aim of this repository

This repository was created to openly share the scripts that I created for the computer-based experiment, as well as the scripts used in data analysis. Thus, I only included scripts, and not stimuli used in the experiment. For the image stimuli used in our experiments, please go to [our repository](https://osf.io/zyfb9/) on Open Science Framework (OSF).
